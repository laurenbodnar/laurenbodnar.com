For the third year in a row I have again doubled my previous years reading goal. I read [15 in 2018](https://medium.com/@laurenbodnar/reading-challenge-2018-b81b41a99d40) and this year I hope to finish 26\. I like to follow [Tim Challies’s reading challenge](https://www.challies.com/resources/the-2019-christian-reading-challenge/) because it forces me to push past my first inclination and expand my mind to new ideas which helps me grow as a person. 26 books seems daunting; that’s more than 2 a month! Especially since 3 years ago my goal of 6 total was pushing it. More so, I recently had a baby and am in the thick of newborn + preschooler life. Still, I believe it’s doable if I prioritize reading over more worthless pursuits like TV, which was one of my [New Years resolutions.](https://medium.com/@laurenbodnar/new-years-day-2019-d9becdf0fb38) I’m finding that I actually love to read and the last few years of my life have been enriched because of it.

This is a living post, and it will continue to be edited throughout 2019 to add reviews as I finish books. Another goal of mine is to write more, so some books will get their own full length review in a separate post but I’ll link it here. The books will be listed in the order I completed them.

I’m shocked to say that as I’m writing the first part of this post it’s the last day in February and I’ve already finished 5 and I’m nearly done with 2 more.

1.  **Book you can finish in a weekend: **[April Morning](https://amzn.to/2Vr1jtA) by Howard Fast**
**[_Read the full review!_](https://medium.com/@laurenbodnar/history-needs-flesh-c369bca2e1dc)_ _
Adam Cooper, a 15 year old boy with an annoying younger brother and an overbearing father retells the events of April 18–19th, 1775\. The first battle of the American Revolution at Lexington and Concord. Adam leaves boyhood behind and becomes a man overnight. It’s a quick, fun read geared toward a younger audience. I enjoyed it, though I will say that it focuses far more on how he processes the events rather than the wartime realities themselves. It’s less violent or graphic than any other wartime book I’ve read.
2.  **Book about history: **[The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic and Madness at the Fair the Changed America](https://amzn.to/2H9hjfs) by Erik LarsonThe Devil in the White City is a non-fiction historical account of two separate but loosely related events and incredibly it reads like a novel. I thoroughly enjoyed this read. A bit gruesome at times, but to be expected when reading about a serial killer. I didn’t know anything about the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair prior to reading this. I was fascinated by all the common place things of our day that originated directly from it in quite interesting (and at times accidental) ways. Things like the Pledge of Allegiance, Pabst Blue Ribbon and most notably, the Ferris Wheel. Fun and highly interesting.
3.  **Book for Children or Teens: **[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe](https://amzn.to/2C0cEsy) by C. S. Lewis
This book hardly needs a review since it’s so widely read. I had never read it as a child though and I decided to check it out from my local library and read it to my daughter. She’s 3 and I wasn’t sure if she’d be able to follow along with a chapter book but I decided to give it a try. The book does have a few illustrations throughout and we reviewed each time we sat down together. It was wonderful! My daughter loved it and was able to keep up and pay attention surprisingly well. Such a sweet experience too. In regards to the novel itself, it’s a wonderful and rich story, simple and easy to follow.
4.  **Book targeted at the opposite gender:** [Of Mice and Men](https://amzn.to/2IGGd8t) by John Steinbeck
An American classic and totally worth the quick read. It’s a bit dark and gritty but real and Steinbeck deals honestly with his central theme of loneliness. I appreciate how to the point this short novel is. Each detail is meaningful, even when you don’t realize it till later. Steinbeck has a lot to say about human utility, relationships, loyalty, and the harsh realities of life for labor workers. This novel, in my opinion, is written for men about men and in fact does not speak favorably about women at all.
5.  **Book more than 100 years old: **[The Count of Monte Cristo](https://amzn.to/2IK1uxV) by Alexandre Dumas
Truly a masterpiece and in fact more than 150 years old as it was written in 1844\. Dumas is a master storyteller. I could not stop raving about this book to my husband and I couldn’t stop listening. I listened to it via Audible, which I highly recommend for 2 reasons. First, the narrator has a different voice for each character and reads with such flare it’s so fun to listen to! Second, unless you are familiar with French, you might find yourself stumbling over nouns that you can’t pronounce and lose a bit of the magic. I cannot even begin to describe the intricate detail with which Dumas weaves this story. There’s a plethora of characters; each one important, full of depth and back story. I believe this might just be my favorite novel of all time. And for the record, the 2002 film is trash. The only people who could possible enjoy it are those who have never read the book.
6.  **Book about aging: **[A Man Called Ove](https://amzn.to/2GZ3cd7) by Fredrik Backman
Ove is a crotchety old Swedish man, lonely and without a proper function after the loss of his wife and forced retirement. He’s the kind of man that believes strongly that there’s a right and a wrong way to live ones life. It’s the kind of novel you find yourself laughing and simultaneously straining to read pages through tears. It’s about family and community. The kind of family God gives unexpectedly after he’s taken some away. The kind you didn’t choose, but chose you and invaded your life while you weren’t looking. It’s about finding new reasons to live and being willing to open your heart after grief has slammed it shut. When finished I found myself giving the book a good pat as if I could give it a hug.
