<br/>
In the past I&#39;ve written a mini review of each book. Well, add that to your list of 2020 disappointments. It just didn&#39;t happen this year. But if a title peeks your interest I&#39;d love to share my thoughts with you.

**Notable tidbits**

I read more fantasy novels than anything else and 7 of those books were written by Brandon Sanderson! This is notable because before last year I think I may have read 5 total fantasy novels in my whole life. In addition to about 300 picture books, Selah and I read 5 chapter books together, I imagine you can easily spot which ones these were. I chose 3 of these books for the sole purpose of educating myself to be better at the things I was pursing. I enjoy reading outside my comfort zone on occasion and I decided to begin working my way through important texts through history. So I finished the year off with 2 ancient texts. Finally, 6 were recommended by my pastor (not including his love of Sanderson books).
