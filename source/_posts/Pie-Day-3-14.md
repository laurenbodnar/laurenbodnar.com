### Happy Pi(e) Day! π

Pi Day is one of those *fake holidays*, generally only celebrated by math teachers and bakeries.<br/>
Today marks my 12th annual Pi Day celebration. In my house Pi Day is a real holiday. Every year I make at least 3 pies and usually host a party to gather family and friends around the table. People who don’t know about Pi Day, or have heard but have never celebrated tend to get pretty excited when I start talking about it. <br/>
Who doesn’t love a low stress random reason to party and eat pie? <br/>
This tradition started for me back in high school. A friend was on a baking kick and had been perfecting her homemade pie crust recipe. She invited some people over and we indulged in the most incredible apple pie I’ve ever eaten. I’ll never forget it. <br/>
Pi Day typically falls on Spring Break so we had all day to labor with love in the kitchen and churn out pie after delicious pie. Over the next few years we continued to celebrate and make pies and host friends. The second year we invited friends to come and go as they pleased all day long. **By day’s end we had seen 90+ people and tasted 20+ pies!** Pi Day turned into something truly precious to me and even though most of those friends have moved on with their lives, I never stopped celebrating. <br/>
**The magic is not in the pie, though a good pie can be quite magical, it’s in the gathering.** <br/>
This year I made [Crustless Blueberry Pie](https://www.averiecooks.com/crustless-blueberry-pie/#) for breakfast to share with a momma friend alongside a warm café con leche while our children covered the floor in train tracks. The chaos of parenting is made sweet by friendship. I also made two [Cold Brew Coffee Pies](https://thedomesticrebel.com/2016/07/20/easy-cold-brew-coffee-pie/). Yum!! I made one to share with the women of my church this evening and one for the house so my hubby wouldn't be left out. I love a good no bake pie for a quick treat that always gets great reviews and is so easy to make. <br/>
I'll go ahead and say it, you should never eat pie alone! It's meant to be shared. Gathering over yummy treats is a joy of life. Friends of different circles celebrating together for no real reason other than the joy of community. March 14th - otherwise a humdrum unassuming day -- is filled with smiles and laughter, the forming and strengthening of new and old friendships. People I haven’t seen in years still wish me a happy Pi Day and those who have been impacted by this most appetizing of holidays spread the joy along to their circle of friends. <br/>
I invite you to join the party. Bake a pie and share it. Discover what joy you might add to your day and someone else's. <br/>
