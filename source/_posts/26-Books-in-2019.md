For the third year in a row I have again doubled my previous years reading goal. I read [15 in 2018](https://medium.com/@laurenbodnar/reading-challenge-2018-b81b41a99d40) and this year I hope to finish 26. I like to follow [Tim Challies’s reading challenge](https://www.challies.com/resources/the-2019-christian-reading-challenge/) because it forces me to push past my first inclination and expand my mind to new ideas which helps me grow as a person.

 26 books seems daunting; that’s more than 2 a month! Especially since 3 years ago my goal of 6 total was pushing it. More so, I recently had a baby and am in the thick of newborn + preschooler life. Still, I believe it’s doable if I prioritize reading over more worthless pursuits like TV, which was one of my New Years resolutions. I’m finding that I actually love to read and the last few years of my life have been enriched because of it.

This is a living post, and it will continue to be edited throughout 2019 to add reviews as I finish books. Another goal of mine is to write more, so some books will get their own full length review in a separate post but I’ll link it here. The books will be listed in the order I completed them.

### Book you can finish in a weekend:

**[April Morning](https://amzn.to/2Vr1jtA) by Howard Fast**
[_Read the full review!_](https://medium.com/@laurenbodnar/history-needs-flesh-c369bca2e1dc)
Adam Cooper, a 15 year old boy with an annoying younger brother and an overbearing father retells the events of April 18–19th, 1775. The first battle of the American Revolution at Lexington and Concord. Adam leaves boyhood behind and becomes a man overnight. It’s a quick, fun read geared toward a younger audience. I enjoyed it, though I will say that it focuses far more on how he processes the events rather than the wartime realities themselves. It’s less violent or graphic than any other wartime book I’ve read.
<br/>

### Book about history:

**[The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic and Madness at the Fair the Changed America](https://amzn.to/2H9hjfs) by Erik Larson**
The Devil in the White City is a non-fiction historical account of two separate but loosely related events and incredibly it reads like a novel. I thoroughly enjoyed this read. A bit gruesome at times, but to be expected when reading about a serial killer. I didn’t know anything about the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair prior to reading this. I was fascinated by all the common place things of our day that originated directly from it in quite interesting (and at times accidental) ways. Things like the Pledge of Allegiance, Pabst Blue Ribbon and most notably, the Ferris Wheel. Fun and highly interesting.
<br/>

### Book for Children or Teens:

**[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe](https://amzn.to/2C0cEsy) by C. S. Lewis**
This book hardly needs a review since it’s so widely read. I had never read it as a child though and I decided to check it out from my local library and read it to my daughter. She’s 3 and I wasn’t sure if she’d be able to follow along with a chapter book but I decided to give it a try. The book does have a few illustrations throughout and we reviewed each time we sat down together. It was wonderful! My daughter loved it and was able to keep up and pay attention surprisingly well. Such a sweet experience too. In regards to the novel itself, it’s a wonderful and rich story, simple and easy to follow.
<br/>

### Book targeted at the opposite gender:

**[Of Mice and Men](https://amzn.to/2IGGd8t) by John Steinbeck**
An American classic and totally worth the quick read. It’s a bit dark and gritty but real and Steinbeck deals honestly with his central theme of loneliness. I appreciate how to the point this short novel is. Each detail is meaningful, even when you don’t realize it till later. Steinbeck has a lot to say about human utility, relationships, loyalty, and the harsh realities of life for labor workers. This novel, in my opinion, is written for men about men and in fact does not speak favorably about women at all.
<br/>

### Book more than 100 years old:

**[The Count of Monte Cristo](https://amzn.to/2IK1uxV) by Alexandre Dumas**
Truly a masterpiece and in fact more than 150 years old as it was written in 1844. Dumas is a master storyteller. I could not stop raving about this book to my husband and I couldn’t stop listening. I listened to it via Audible, which I highly recommend for 2 reasons. First, the narrator has a different voice for each character and reads with such flare it’s so fun to listen to! Second, unless you are familiar with French, you might find yourself stumbling over nouns that you can’t pronounce and lose a bit of the magic. I cannot even begin to describe the intricate detail with which Dumas weaves this story. There’s a plethora of characters; each one important, full of depth and back story. I believe this might just be my favorite novel of all time. And for the record, the 2002 film is trash. The only people who could possible enjoy it are those who have never read the book.
<br/>

### Book about aging:

**[A Man Called Ove](https://amzn.to/2GZ3cd7) by Fredrik Backman**
Ove is a crotchety old Swedish man, lonely and without a proper function after the loss of his wife and forced retirement. He’s the kind of man that believes strongly that there’s a right and a wrong way to live ones life. It’s the kind of novel you find yourself laughing and simultaneously straining to read pages through tears. It’s about family and community. The kind of family God gives unexpectedly after he’s taken some away. The kind you didn’t choose, but chose you and invaded your life while you weren’t looking. It’s about finding new reasons to live and being willing to open your heart after grief has slammed it shut. When finished I found myself giving the book a good pat as if I could give it a hug.
<br/>

### Book of 100 pages or less

**[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://amzn.to/2u1O5as) by Lewis Carroll**
I have no idea why this book is such a classic. Perhaps I'm a curmudgeon with no sense of creativity or child-like dreams, but frankly I hated it. After having read Chronicles of Narnia with my daughter I found this at the library and thought she would love it. I was really only familiar with the story characters and not so much the story itself. The book is utter nonsense, which I guess is the appeal. But it is very difficult to follow and certainly for children it's silly gibberish that's so confusing it's not even fun. I only finished it for the sake of follow-through with my daughter.
<br/>

### Book a friend recommends

**[Let me be a Woman](https://amzn.to/2CfjYkt) by Elisabeth Elliot**
I have mixed feelings about this book and honestly need to spend some time reflecting more in depth about it. But it's also been over a month since I read it and I haven't had the alone time or mental clarity to do that yet. This book provides a lot of nuggets of truth and helpful reminders about biblical womanhood in all aspects of life. Published in 1976 it's extremely challenging towards the typical world views of our 2019 society. In a way, the book was uncomfortable. She's shares some fairly stereotypical 50's housewife type ideas. I had to put it down several times to consider if my negative reactions to it were because her ideas were outdated, or if she was totally right in ways I've been so culturally conditioned to disagree with. In the end, I think both. The book is full of biblical explanations of what it is to be female the way God created. But also some of her practical examples of how this femininity might work itself out are a relic of her time. It takes a lot of discernment and heart searching to figure out which is which.

### Book about Christian Living

**[Understanding Baptism](https://amzn.to/2Du2kd3) by Bobby Jamieson**
Great! Short, to the point, easy to read and very helpful. I highly recommend for any believer new and old that feels unsure they know the **why** behind what they believe about baptism. This booklet covers the foundation of what is baptism, what it is not, who should be baptized and who should do the baptism. As well as why and when baptism is different than getting dunked in any random body of water at any random time. Honestly it cleared up a bit of confusion I had surrounding my own baptism and I'm grateful.

### A Novel

**[Salvage the Bones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608196267/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=laurenbodnar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1608196267&linkId=5e169b60fe68a29b65764337385c423f) by Jesmyn Ward**
I had expectations for this book going into it that effected the way I feel about it now that I'm finished. Unfortunately I wanted to enjoy it more than I did. I thought the book was going to follow a family through Hurricane Katrina. I wanted to step outside myself and see that event through the eyes of someone who lived it. I spent the whole novel waiting for the hurricane to come. Really the story was set a few days leading up to the hurricane and ended a day or two after. The book really was not at all about the hurricane itself. It was about life as a poor black family living in rural Mississippi. In this regard I'm glad I read it. It stretched me and made me uncomfortable at times, which I'm sure was one of the goals of the author.
</br>

### Book about Theology

**[The Baptism of Disciples Alone: A Covenantal Argument for Credobaptism versus Paedobaptism](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0978571134/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=laurenbodnar-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0978571134&linkId=506f93d1562d6d5f6264b7d28fa3fb49) by Fred Malone**
I really enjoyed this book, though at times I had to reread a few paragraphs. Malone is gracious to our paedobaptist brothers and sisters and truly desires the truth of God's word to be clearly understood and taught by all. He dismantles arguments used by prominent paedobaptist teachers by showing the error and inconsistencies within them. Ultimately he argues that the paedobaptist position hinges on "an erroneous use of good and necessary inference" and does not actually follow the regulative principle of worship which paedobaptists themselves claim to hold to. Not only was I edified by this work regarding the doctrine of believers baptism I also learned a great deal about other theological concepts such as the regulative principle. This one is not for everyone, but I believe anyone who puts in the effort will benefit from this brother.

### Book Recommended by a Family Member
**[The Way of Kings](https://amzn.to/2FC8KrZ) by Brandon Sanderson**
Book one of The Stormlight Archive, an epic fantasy series recommended to me by my husband after he consumed every book available by the author last year. This is such and outlier for me as I never read fantasy or sci-fi. I haven't even read Harry Potter. It took me a bit of effort to get hooked into it because there's so much going on and I'm not familiar with books that build new worlds and magic systems. Once I got into it though, I could not put it down. Straight through the second book. The book switches between several characters point of view until they eventually all begin to merge into the greater story. The world is one beset with wars, assassins, chasm fiends, and deadly storms that fuel the magic system with stormlight. Sanderson crafts an incredibly intricate social hierarchy, religious systems, and world history that all play major roles in the overall story. It's rare that a book causes me to literally exclaim "WOAH" out loud when the most unexpected thing happened! It's a thrilling read and you won't stop here.

### Book With At Least 400 Pages
**[Words of Radiance](https://amzn.to/2IV1lEQ) by Brandon Sanderson**
1087 pages exactly. And it took me 6 days to finish. Riding the high of book one, I consumed the second Stormlight Archive book in record time. I also got a lot less sleep that week. As good as the first, with still more twists and turns and mysteries revealed. The character development in these books is fantastic. Part of the magic system requires the characters to wrestle a bit with who they are and who they will chose to be. This means that every character has depth, none outshines the others. I highly recommend this series. Book two comes to a more complete finish, though there is plenty of cliffhanger leading into book 3 (and the novella that takes place in between). It's easier to pause here and take a break but I'm looking forwarding to finishing the next ones. Sanderson isn't yet done writing the epic saga that is planned to be 10 books long! I'm totally sucked in, I'll read them all.

### Book By or About a Missionary

**[Filling Up the Afflictions of Christ: The Cost of Bringing the Gospel to the Nations in the Lives of William Tyndale, Adoniram Judson, and John Paton](https://amzn.to/2L8QmKA) by John Piper**
I've had this on my shelf for several years never making it to the top of my book stack. But we moved and I don't even know where my book stack is, but I found this one and decided to give it a go. I think I never picked it up because I knew what laid inside would twist my heart in ways I didn't want to deal with. If you're unfamiliar with Tyndale, Judson, and Paton they are all remarkable men who gave their lives for the sake of spreading the gospel. These men took God's promises seriously and they put everything on the line, enduring sorrow upon sorrow while clinging to the one true God they knew was in control. Their stories are inspiring and convicting. Much of what they suffered and died for, I often take for granted. Piper endeavors to provide short, easy to read summaries of each of their lives and lasting impact and does so with a surprising amount of passion. Despite being so short each story is compelling as Piper boiled each down to a laser focus using the three together to make a larger point to his readers. God uses the suffering of his people to display the sufferings and love of Jesus to the world. What you believe about God and the worth you place in heavenly things versus earthly things is bound to challenged by this book.

### Bonus Book

**[Babe the Gallant Pig](https://amzn.to/2ICKIAc) by Dick King-Smith**
I list this as a Bonus Book because I'm not counting it toward my 26. This is the 3rd chapter book I've read to my daughter this year. I'm listing it here because I've never read it before and honestly, it's still a full size book even though it's geared toward young readers. It's a fun read and my almost 4 year old was able to follow along well. I changed some words on the fly though so she could understand it better and so she wouldn't go around say the B word thinking it's only meaning was to refer to a female dog.
