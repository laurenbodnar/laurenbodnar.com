Books serve all kinds of purposes. Some educate, some excite the imagination, some weigh heavily on the mind.

The best kind of book warms the soul.

As part of my [26 books in 2019](https://medium.com/@laurenbodnar/26-books-in-2019-f7b21c69c383) challenge I needed to read “A book about aging.” Not yet 30, this idea was not greatly exciting and I wasn’t interested in reading a book I wouldn’t enjoy simply to check a box. After a quick google search though, I decided to give one a try.

[A Man Called Ove](https://amzn.to/2GZ3cd7) by Fredrik Backman is this soul warming best kind of book. Ove is a crotchety old Swedish man, lonely and without a proper function after the loss of his wife and forced retirement. He’s the kind of man that believes strongly that there’s a right and a wrong way to live ones life.
> “He was a man of black and white. And she was color. All the color he had. The only thing he had ever loved until he saw her was numbers.”

As you begin to truly get to know him — as difficult as that may be — his faults are forgivable and even lovable. The novel is hilarious as Ove interacts with those around him and navigates the modern day that seemed to move forward without him. Yet, also it’s the kind of novel you find yourself smiling while simultaneously straining to read pages through tears.

It’s about family and community. The kind of family God gives unexpectedly after he’s taken some away. The kind you didn’t choose, but chose you and invaded your life while you weren’t looking. It’s about finding new reasons to live and being willing to open your heart after grief has slammed it shut.
> “You’re the funniest thing she knows. That’s why she always draws you in color”

Turning the final pages and setting it down feels like saying goodbye to a good friend. I found myself giving the book a good pat as if I could give it a hug.

[A Man Called Ove](https://amzn.to/2GZ3cd7) warms the soul.
