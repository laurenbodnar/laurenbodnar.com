My first child was a honeymoon baby and though I was overjoyed to have her, I was not at all ready for her.

I had just gotten married and had not yet figured out what my new normal looked like. Not only that, but I was still very early in building my Real Estate career.

After she was born I tried to keep up my old life as much as possible. I planned to be a work from home mom, keeping her with me every day. I knew that I would have to make small changes to how I did things, but I was sure that I could still make it all happen.

I was wrong.

My real estate career fizzled out pretty quickly after she passed the sleeps all the time stage. In less than a years time I had gone from single to married with an infant. Shortly before we got married we decided to change churches and Daniel got a new job. To top it off, we moved into a new rental house two weeks before she was born.

So. Much. Change.

We won't mention all the changes that come simply by being a first time parent. I was exhausted. Lost in the weeds of early motherhood trying desperately to hold on to the life I had before because it was the only thing I understood.

 But I had no more coworkers, or continuing education. I wasn't attending networking socials or keeping up with market changes. I was washing my spit up stained shirts for the millionth time. I wasn't meeting friends for drinks or movies or game nights. I was asleep before 9pm most days.

Breastfeeding was a huge learning curve and for a while I didn't leave the house much because it was easier to manage in private. My baby was too little for playdates or to explore fun places, so I was alone.

It wasn't all bad; I enjoyed most days. She and I would snuggle on the couch and I would watch a lot Netflix while she slept. We'd take walks around the neighborhood and then I'd fold laundry and watch more tv or scroll through social media again.

In hindsight I realize that for most of her first year of life the only inputs I had on a regular basis was family, tv and Facebook. Most on my mental energy was spent over thinking things. I'd get anxious about some issue and stew on it. I read everything google would give me about sleep schedules, breastfeeding, childhood development, cloth diapering, etc. My mind became consumed by motherhood and parenting issues. There was nothing else.

I was too tired for anything else. My daughter didn't sleep through the night till she was a year old. This is the belief I held. I was too tired to read, too exhausted to study the bible, too brain fogged to put my mind to use. It was a lie and it led to a few wasteful and depressed years.

Don't get me wrong, I **was** tired, but that was an excuse and I used it far beyond it's true reach. Motherhood culture today has a lot to say about tired, coffee dependent, yoga pant wearing moms. This belief that young moms are too tired to accomplish any mental pursuit is pervasive. Take a look at the theological depth of almost any Christian program marketed to mothers. *(that's a rant for another day)*

The message is that young moms are too tired for mental pursuits and that's completely ok because nothing more is expected of them.



  Reading gave me life again. It sparks new ideas and fed my brain something to think about, consider my positions on, etc.

  Being a stay at home mom is wonderful for so many reasons, but it can also isolate you to the walls of your home and only communicating with tiny people if you let it. I felt like the only think I had to talk about with people was about my kids. My only news came from social media, my only cultural input was netflix.

  “Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge; it is thinking that makes what we read ours.”
― John Locke
